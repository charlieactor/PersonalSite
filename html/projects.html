    <h3 class="proj"><a href="https://github.com/charlieactor/Skill-Distillery/tree/master/workspace/LordOfObjects">BlackJack</a></h3>
    <p>Charlie made this project after just three weeks of learning Java. The game utilizes
      object oriented modeling to create a deck (object) of cards (objects), and has the dealer
      (object) deal said cards out to the player (object) and dealer (still an object). </p>

    <h3 class="proj"><a href="https://github.com/charlieactor/Skill-Distillery/tree/master/workspace/Roman%20Numerals">Manbeast: The Text-Adventure Game</h3></a>
    <p>Charlie and his friend Andy Wynyard programmed Manbeast one sunny afternoon, and get very into the story of it all.
      Possibly too into the story of it, but hey, it ended up pretty hilarious. This game makes use of a multitude of objects,
      arrays of possible insults, and a random attack probability mechanism, varying based on the character's strengths/weaknesses.</p>

    <h3 class="proj"><a href="https://github.com/charlieactor/Skill-Distillery/tree/master/workspace/Roman%20Numerals/src/romanNumerals">Roman Numeral Translator</a></h3>
      <p>Charlie created this Roman Numeral Translator in his fourth week at Skill Distillery. The translator
         takes a user-inputted number and translates that input to a roman numeral. This was a good first
         use of Hashmaps and test-oriented programming.</p>

    <h3 class="proj"><a href="https://github.com/charlieactor/Skill-Distillery/tree/master/workspace/TestPrep/src/ocp/prep">Random Student-Topic Assigner</a></h3>
    <p>Charlie created this random student-topic assigner, that allows the user to enter as many students as they like and as
      many topics as they like, and randomly assign those topics to students equally until all topics are assigned.
      This program uses a hashmap to randomly assign topics (values) to the student (keys).</p>
