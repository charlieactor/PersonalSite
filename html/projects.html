    <h3><a href="https://github.com/charlieactor/BlackJackProject">BlackJack Project</a></h3>
    <p>Charlie made this project after just three weeks of learning Java. The game utilizes
      object oriented modeling to create a deck (object) of cards (objects), and has the dealer
      (object) deal said cards out to the player (object) and dealer (still an object). </p>

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/charlieactor/Skill-Distillery/tree/master/workspace/Roman%20Numerals">
      Roman Numeral Translator</a></h3>
      <p>Charlie created this Roman Numeral Translator in his fourth week at Skill Distillery. The translator
         takes a user-inputted number and translates that input to a roman numeral. This was a good first
         use of Hashmaps and test-oriented programming.</p>
